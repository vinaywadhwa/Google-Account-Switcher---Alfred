Then, setup the keyboard shortcuts for each of the accounts, say

### 🗒 Note
- You must be logged in with the aforementioned accounts already. Which of the 3 accounts you log into first has no effect on the way the workflow functions.
- Firefox not supported, for now, sorry! [This](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/2013-how-to-get-frontmost-tab%E2%80%99s-url-and-title-of-various-browsers/) is why.
